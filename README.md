# AI-MachineLearning
In this repo I have notebooks made in Google Colab where I worked on some of my Machine Learning school project.

# HW 1
On this Folder you can find:
### Part 1
* 3D graph plots and density and contour plots with their local minimum, maximum and Saddle points marked.
### Part 2
* A notebook for solving linear regression using stochastic gradient descent 
### Part 3
* What does an average MNIST digit look like

# HW 2
### Part 1
* Single Dense Layer Neural Network + Handcrafted Features for Labeling MNIST Digits
### Part 2
* An example of a Model that Underfits. The model is too simple and cannot explain the data.
* An example of a Model that Overfits. The model is unnecessarily complex so it can easily adapt too much to the training data. In addition, the model tarins for too long, and having too much exposure to the same data will lead to Overfiting.
* An example of a Model that is "Pretty Good". The model is neither too simple, nor too complex. In addition, the model didn't train for too many epochs, and I use dropout to fight overfitting.
